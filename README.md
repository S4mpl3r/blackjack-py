## Overview

An overly good-looking command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. This project aims to provide an enjoyable experience for players interested in the classic card game Blackjack. It uses the [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) package to make the command-line interface a little less boring.

## Features

- Player vs. Dealer gameplay.
- Command-line interface for ease of use.
- Basic Blackjack rules implemented (hit, stand, might implement other rules in the future).
- The ability to save (what?!).
